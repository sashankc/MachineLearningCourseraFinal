# MachineLearningCourseraFinal
Machine Learning final assignment submission

This is the final submission for the Machine Learning coursera course.
The submission has a .RMD file as well as image and write up about the process that was followed to solve this assignment.

The assingment is about measuring the Quality of the exercise based on the data collected from various devices. It takes into account different data from various sensors and categories them.
In this case the data measured is for the Biceps training, there are 5 different ways to do this exercise (A, B, C, D and E) however only method 'A is the correct way to do this exercise. 
The assingment was to train a model based on previously collected data and use it to predict the potential outcome from the testing data.
The general approach is that the training data is further split into training and verification, The model is trained using training data and further evaluated using the verfication dataset. 
Once a satisifactory prediction is recorded, the model is further used to predict the outcome using the testing data set.
